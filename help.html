<h3 class="about-h3">The Future of Mars Exploration</h3>

    <p class="help-p">As space technology continues to advance rapidly, significant opportunities and milestones in the exploration of Mars are unveiled. ⁤⁤Current rovers such as Perseverance or Zhurong will continue to explore the planet's geology and look for evidence of ancient or modern life, along with determining if Mars is truly habitable or not. ⁤⁤These rovers possess the main goal of returning with materials for further research and experimentation, collecting samples of rock and soil from Mars and transporting it back to Earth. ⁤⁤⁤⁤Human exploration initiatives are also gaining momentum, intending to send astronauts to Mars in the future, either for long-term stays or to establish a permanent human presence on the red planet. ⁤⁤With the rise in global climate change and concerns about catastrophic events on Earth, it is pertinent to continue exploring Mars in search of another habitable planet. These missions not only broaden our knowledge of Mars but also set the stage for further interplanetary research for human exploration in the wider solar system. ⁤⁤In the years to come, we can expect to see a lot more discoveries in the exploration of Mars and the wider mysteries of the universe, as well as significant technological advancements. ⁤
